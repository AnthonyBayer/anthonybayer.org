I don't know what to write.

I guess I'll start at the obvous: I can't remember what day it is  - I get drunk too often to reliably keep track. And if I'm not drunk I'm high or bored off my fucking mind.

I haven't been going to school. I haven't been eating right or taking care of myself.

Anyhony is letting me stay in his house. He's never here, he must have multiple.

I'm scared to leave, this is the only place I feel safe.

He's been so nice to me, and never asked questions. It's definitely the alchohol talking but I'm going to answer them.
