My mind sunk deeper into the game, nothing but what was on the court and the scoreboard existed.

Fifteen seconds, one point down, fatigue, sweat, noise.

Our possession, with set up offense.

Failure, ball was stolen. Their possession.

Ten seconds. Run, fast. No shot.

Ball stolen again, our possession.

Five seconds. Science, tension, unpredictiveness.

Teammate open, pass.

Three seconds.

Shot missed.

Two seconds.

Rebounded shot.

One second.

Shoot.

Buzzer.

Made basket.
