I'm too scared to say anything, out of fear of being wrong, but I know I can't be.

I'm too worried about my hair or my voice, even though none of those things matter to you.

Instead I'm just sitting here, pretending to work, looking at your flower-print dress and your curly-blonde hair.

Trying, to figure myself out.
