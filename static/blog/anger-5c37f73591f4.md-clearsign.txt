I sat staring out at the near-dead sunset. There was still some color, but mostly the sky was fading into the regular LA night sky - washed out by all the life.

I drank some of my Whiskey. It tasted terrible - exactly how I liked it. I talked unintelligibly to myself in my head.

All of a sudden, I threw my glass on the hardwood floor. It shatered, leaving big and small peices of glass everywhere. A second or two later I started crying.
