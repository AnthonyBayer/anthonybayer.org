Jessica was in the backyard talking to Max Thornhill, a classmate of ours. "I think that she's a good fit for you, but I just think she's a total- Oh hey, Anthony."

"Hello, Jessica. Hello, Max." I said. "What were you guys talking about?"

"I got a girlfriend" Max said. "She's a freshmen - her name is Samantha, you might know her."

"I do not." I said.

"Don't take this the wrong way, but who are you?" Max asked me.

"Oh, Jessica and I have known each other for a few years, we went to middle school together. I know you though, you're Max Thornhill."

"Oh cool. Wait, how do you know who I am?"

"I learn names and faces really easily, I must've overheard someone saying your name to you or something."

"I know Samantha," Jessica said, "Not very well though, we just have history and math together. I was just saying how I think she's a total-"

"Okay, Jessica" Max said, quite annoyed, "You don't like her. I do though, she's really nice."

"So you're not at all interested in her because she's a D cup?"

"That's a loaded question and you know it, Jessica."

"Oh right, you're speech and debate, I forgot I can't have a petty argument against you." Jessica jeered.

"Well, anyway," Max said, "Nice to meet you, Anthony" He fist-bumped me,

"You two wanna get a hot dog or something?"
