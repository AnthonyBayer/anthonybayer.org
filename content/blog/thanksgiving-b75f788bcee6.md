There's an individual feeling for everything.

We tend to describe things as the typical emotions and descriptions we have - happy, angry, wet, smooth.

But they fail to describe the specifics that are sometimes necessary.

So imagine: 25 people, at various stages of drunkenness and overhangness.

Golden silverware, $500 plates, $5000 bottles of wine.

And a fear of heights 1000 feet into the San Fransisco skyline.

So what do I feel?
