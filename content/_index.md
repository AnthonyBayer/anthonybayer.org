## About

![headshot](/images/face-square.jpg)

Anthony Bayer is a pseudonym created sometime around 2017. He was born march 27th, 2022. He's a gay boy who is good with computers and bad with social anxiety. He currently lives in Boston and attends MIT for a BS in Computer Science. He is part of a crime family that manipulates financial markets for profit.

Anthony was created to give the real person behind the pseudonym a safe place to express his emotions. He eventually, and unintentionally, created a unique world with weird and interesting characters to help him express them.
